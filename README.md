## My process

### Built with

- Angular
- TailwindCSS
- Java Springboot (under development)

### What I learned

This was my first experience with Angular. I've learned about component creation and management. As well as passing state between components through services via Classes. 

#### A few awesome things I learned was:

Creating a service with an observable property checking for when an invoice is edited, which toggles the the invoice edit status and emmits it to the subscriber:

```typescript
private _invoiceEdited$: BehaviorSubject<boolean> = new BehaviorSubject<boolean>(false);

get invoiceEdited$(): Observable<boolean> { 
  return this._invoiceEdited$.asObservable();
}

public invoiceEditToggle(): void { 
  let toggle = !this._invoiceEdited$.getValue();
  this._invoiceEdited$.next(toggle);
}
```

Conditionally showing a section if true, otherwise triggering a different section via template variable:

```html
<section *ngIf="(invoices.length < 1); else invoiceSection" ...>
```

### Continued development

The plan is the have this application as a fullstack application using Java.
